/// UpdateCampaignCommandHandler and DeleteDraftCampaignCommandHandler, each of which was a
/// separate MediatR <c>IRequestHandler</c> in its own folder. MediatR is gone: the controller
/// injects this handler and calls it directly, so the path from route to logic is one you can
/// follow by clicking rather than one the container assembles at runtime.
///
/// THREE THINGS EACH OF THOSE HANDLERS DID BY HAND ARE NOW AUTOMATIC, and every one of them
/// was a place to forget something:
///
///   - <c>entity.OrganisationId = currentUser.OrganisationId</c>. The DbContext stamps it from
///     the tenant context, so a handler cannot write a row owned by the wrong Organisation and
///     cannot write one owned by nobody.
///   - <c>CreatedAtUtc</c>, <c>UpdatedByUserId</c>, <c>Version++</c>. Stamped on save. The old
///     code incremented the version by hand in each handler, and any handler that forgot broke
///     concurrency detection silently.
///   - Validation by <c>throw new CustomValidationException</c>. FluentValidation runs in the
///     pipeline and a refusal is a Result, so a validation failure is no longer an exception
///     unwinding through middleware.
