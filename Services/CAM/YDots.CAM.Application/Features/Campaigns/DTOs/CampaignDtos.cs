/// <summary>
/// Creating a campaign - the four wizard steps, in one request.
///
/// NO OrganisationId FIELD, and that absence is the security control. The Organisation comes
/// from the token and is stamped by the DbContext; a caller who could name it could create a
/// campaign inside somebody else's Organisation.
///
/// EVERY FIELD THE WIZARD MARKS WITH AN ASTERISK IS REQUIRED HERE, which is the change from the
/// version this replaces. State, city, zip code, channels, the reminder pair and both
/// publication fields were all optional on the contract while the screens presented them as
/// mandatory, so a campaign could be saved with the second and third steps effectively empty -
/// and the campaign detail then had nothing to show for either, which is exactly the "many
/// details are not showing" the QA pass reported. The columns behind them stay NULLABLE so
/// campaigns created before this change still load; it is the contract that refuses to create
/// another one.
///
/// <c>DaysBeforeStart</c> and <c>ReminderTime</c> ARE NULLABLE ON THE REQUEST AND NOT ON THE
/// ROW. An int and a TimeOnly cannot tell "the user chose zero" from "the client never sent the
/// field", and the reminder pair is the one place where 0 and midnight are both legitimate
/// answers. Nullable here lets the validator insist on a choice; the handler then writes the
/// value the caller actually made.
///
/// <c>Status</c> accepts only Draft or Submitted. Everything past that is reached through the
/// lifecycle endpoints, each of which has its own permission and its own rules - letting a
/// create call arrive with Status = Active would route around all of them.
/// </summary>
// TargetAmount and BudgetAmount ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT while Target & Budget is on hold. No
// screen collects either, so carrying them on this contract only offered a money field nothing
// validated and nothing displayed. A campaign is created with a target of 0 until the module
// returns and brings its own request with it.
