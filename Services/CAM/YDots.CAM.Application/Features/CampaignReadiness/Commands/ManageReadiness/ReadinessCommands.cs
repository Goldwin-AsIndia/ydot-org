/// The campaign readiness checklist.
///
/// THE CHECKLIST IS A GATE, NOT A NOTE. Its whole purpose is to stop a campaign going live
/// without its payment configuration, its consent wording or its tracking in place, so the
/// rules here are about who may declare what:
///
///   - A check may only be judged while it is PENDING. Re-opening a decided check goes through
///     raising a blocker, which leaves a record of why.
///   - A check with an OPEN BLOCKER cannot be passed. Signing off something a colleague has
///     flagged is exactly what the blocker exists to prevent.
///   - Raising a blocker FAILS the check it is raised against, so the checklist total reflects
///     reality immediately rather than after somebody remembers to change the status too.
///
/// WHAT LEFT THIS SLICE. It used to contain ApproveCampaignReadinessCommand and
/// RequestCampaignReadinessApprovalCommand, which moved a CAMPAIGN through Submitted to
/// Approved from inside the readiness feature - a second, parallel approval path with its own
/// copy of the status rules and NO segregation-of-duties check. Campaign approval now happens
/// in one place, <c>CampaignLifecycleCommandHandler</c>, which checks the readiness gate as
/// part of activation. What remains here is returning a campaign to Draft, which is genuinely
/// a readiness decision.
