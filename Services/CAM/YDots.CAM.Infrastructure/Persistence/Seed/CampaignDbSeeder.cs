/// stamped with a hard-coded <c>OrganisationId</c> of
/// <c>00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000011</c>, matching the fake Organisation the stubbed
/// <c>CurrentUser</c> returned. With real tenancy in place that Organisation does not exist,
/// so those rows would be invisible to every genuine caller: present in the database, returned
/// by nothing, and confusing to the first person who went looking for them.
///
/// Sample campaign data belongs to a demo fixture keyed on a real seeded Organisation, not to
/// the startup path of the production service. What remains here is the reference data the
/// module genuinely cannot function without - a tracking asset cannot be created without a
/// channel, a source and a medium to name.
///
/// ONE CAMPAIGN IS SEEDED AGAIN, AND THE DIFFERENCE FROM WHAT WAS REMOVED IS THE ORGANISATION.
/// It is stamped with <c>SeedSettings:OrganisationId</c> - the same value IAM gives the activated
/// sample Organisation and DON stamps its own demonstration data with - so a real administrator's
/// token carries the Organisation the row belongs to and the campaign is visible where the old
/// fabricated one was not. It exists because a fresh database otherwise has no campaign at all:
/// the donation form's picker is empty, no tracking asset can be generated, and nothing
/// downstream of a campaign can be exercised until somebody drives the creation wizard by hand.
///
/// IT IS APPROVED AND FULLY READY, deliberately. An approved campaign with every required
/// readiness check passed is the only state from which the whole donation flow can be walked -
/// the picker offers only campaigns that have passed approval, and the launch gate refuses one
/// with an outstanding required check.
///
/// IT IS IDEMPOTENT. Each row is checked by its fixed id before insert, so the seeder runs on
/// every start without duplicating anything and a reference row added in a later release
/// reaches an existing database by deploying and restarting.
///
/// THE IDS CARRY OVER UNCHANGED from the previous seed data, so an existing CAM database keeps
/// working: the rows it already has are recognised rather than duplicated.
