    /// "no rows means no restriction" - so nothing had ever written any, and an administrator who
    /// opened Menu Mapping to see which role reached which screen was shown a blank grid and left

    ///
    /// The second is that a blank grid is dangerous to edit. Tick one box in an empty grid and
    /// the save writes exactly one row - and every other node for that role now has a row saying
    /// nothing while one says yes, which reads to a person as "only this one is mapped". Seeding
    /// the full grid means an administrator changes a decision that is already written down
    /// rather than creating the first one by accident.

    /// IT CANNOT GRANT ANYTHING, and that is what makes it safe to write in bulk. RoleMenu is a
