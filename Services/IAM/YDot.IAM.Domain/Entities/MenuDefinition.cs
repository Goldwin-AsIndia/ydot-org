/// <summary>
/// One node of the navigation tree: a Menu, a SubMenu or a ChildSubMenu.
///
/// THE THREE-TABLE SHAPE, AND WHY. The brief asks for a dynamically generated menu with
/// three levels. That is modelled as three tables rather than one:
///
/// <code>
/// MenuDefinition  (global)        what screens exist at all
///     |
///     +-- TenantMenu  (per Tenant)  which of them this Organisation switched on,
///     |                             and what it calls them
///     |
///     +-- RoleMenu    (per Tenant)  which roles inside it can see each one
/// </code>
///
/// This table is the first of the three and is deliberately GLOBAL — no TenantId. A screen
/// either exists in the deployed software or it does not; that is a fact about the build,
/// not about a customer. Copying it per Organisation would mean every new screen needed a
/// row inserted into every Tenant, and a Tenant created next year would silently miss
/// anything shipped before it.
///
/// What varies per Organisation is captured next door in <see cref="TenantMenu"/>, so an
/// Organisation can rename, reorder, hide or never enable a node without the catalogue
/// itself being touched.
///
/// THE TREE IS SELF-REFERENCING. <see cref="ParentMenuId"/> gives arbitrary depth;
/// <see cref="Level"/> records which of the three tiers the node is meant to occupy, so the
/// UI can style each tier and a validator can refuse a fourth level rather than rendering
/// something the theme has no design for.
///
/// VISIBILITY IS PERMISSION-DRIVEN. <see cref="RequiredPermissionCode"/> is what makes the
/// menu honest: a node whose permission the caller does not hold is not returned at all, so
/// the navigation never offers a screen that would answer 403.
/// </summary>

    ///
    /// THE TABLE WAS DELIBERATELY GLOBAL AND MOSTLY STILL IS. The class comment above explains
    /// why: a screen either exists in the deployed software or it does not, and copying the
    /// catalogue per Organisation would mean every new screen needed a row inserted into every
    /// Tenant. Null still means exactly that - a row the platform ships, visible to every
    /// Organisation, editable only by a platform administrator.
    ///
    /// WHAT THIS ADDS is the other half: a node an Organisation created FOR ITSELF. It is
    /// visible only to that Organisation, editable only by it, and invisible to the platform
    /// catalogue screen. Without it, "let an organisation add a menu" would have meant writing
    /// into the shared catalogue, where one charity's menu item would appear in every other
    /// charity's sidebar.
    ///
    /// IT IS NOT CALLED TenantId, AND THAT IS ON PURPOSE. <see cref="TenantEntity"/> carries a
    /// TenantId that the DbContext stamps automatically and the global query filters match on;
    /// this entity is an <see cref="AuditEntity"/> and must NOT join that machinery, because a
    /// platform row has no Tenant and a filtered query would hide the entire catalogue from
    /// everybody. A different name keeps the two mechanisms from being confused for each other.
