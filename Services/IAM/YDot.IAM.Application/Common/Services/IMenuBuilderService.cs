/// Assembles the navigation tree the client renders.

/// THE TREE IS BUILT ON THE SERVER, DELIBERATELY. Four things have to be combined before
/// anything can be drawn — the global catalogue, the Organisation overrides, the role
/// mappings and the caller permission set — and sending the raw tables to Angular to join
/// would put an authorisation decision in the browser, where it can be edited.
///
/// A NODE THE CALLER CANNOT USE IS NOT RETURNED AT ALL. Not disabled, not greyed out:
/// absent. A greyed-out item still tells somebody the screen exists and invites them to go
/// looking for it.
///
/// THE ORDER OF THE FILTERS MATTERS:
///
/// <code>
/// 1. catalogue           what screens exist in this build
/// 2. platform-only       dropped unless the caller is SuperAdmin
/// 3. no Organisation     Tenant work dropped for a SuperAdmin who has not entered one
/// 4. Organisation switch dropped if this Tenant disabled the node
/// 5. approval            dropped while the Organisation is still onboarding
/// 6. permission          dropped if the caller lacks RequiredPermissionCode
/// 7. role mapping        dropped if every one of the caller roles hides it
/// 8. empty groups        a group whose children all vanished is dropped too
/// </code>
///
/// Step 8 is what stops the sidebar showing a heading that expands to nothing.
///
/// STEP 5 IS A LIFECYCLE GATE, NOT A PERMISSION ONE. An Organisation that has not been
/// approved sees only the screens onboarding needs, however complete its administrator's
/// permission set is - and a TenantAdmin's is complete from the moment the Organisation is
/// created. SuperAdmin is exempt, because reviewing a submission means entering an
/// Organisation that is by definition not approved yet.
