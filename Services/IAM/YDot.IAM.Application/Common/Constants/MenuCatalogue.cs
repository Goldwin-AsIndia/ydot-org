/// The global navigation catalogue, seeded into <c>MenuDefinition</c> on first run.
///
/// WHY IT IS CODE RATHER THAN DATA. These rows describe what the deployed software actually
/// contains, and the routes have to match the Angular router or the sidebar produces dead
/// links. Keeping the list beside the permission codes means a new screen is added in one
/// place and the seeder reconciles it on the next start, rather than needing a hand-written
/// migration per screen.
///
/// THE ROUTES ARE REAL. Every <c>Route</c> below corresponds to a path in the client
/// <c>app.routes.ts</c>. A node with a null route is a grouping header that expands but does
/// not navigate.
///
/// PLATFORM NODES ARE MARKED. Anything with <c>IsPlatformOnly</c> is only ever returned to
/// SuperAdmin, however a Tenant configures its roles.
/// </summary>
/// WHAT IS SWITCHED OFF, AND WHY. Finance, Communications and Supply carry
/// <c>IsEnabledByDefault: false</c>: no FIN, COM or INV service exists, so every screen behind
/// them would open on nothing. Three Workspace screens are off for a sharper reason - they call
/// no endpoint at all and render invented names, which is the last thing that should appear in
/// a demonstration. Turning a branch back on is a one-word edit here, or a TenantMenu override
/// per Organisation.
///
/// NOTE THE TWO PARENTS THAT STAY ON. "Money" is the parent of the PAY branch and "Workspace"
/// is the parent of Global Search, so disabling either would take a working module down with

        // and its Quick Reference Summary names four. The Angular route is gone, so leaving the
        // node would put an item in the sidebar that resolves to page-not-found, which is the one
        // failure the note below is about. Dropping the code here retires the row on the next
        // start for every Organisation that already has it, overrides and role mappings intact.

        // resolve is worse than a missing one: the item renders, someone clicks it, and the
