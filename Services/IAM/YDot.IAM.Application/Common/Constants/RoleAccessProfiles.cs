/// catalogue, so a mistyped grant does not fail - it silently does not exist, and the first anyone
/// hears of it is a 403 on a screen that should have worked. Deriving both sets from the same
/// catalogue the permissions are seeded from makes that class of error impossible, and means a
/// permission added to CAM, DON or PAY next month lands in the right role by itself.

/// <c>cam.campaigns.close</c> is declared Approve ("approve a closure request") while
