/// THERE IS NO USER ID IN THIS ROUTE, exactly as on <see cref="MySecurityController"/>, and for
/// the same reason: the server acts on whoever holds the token, so the request cannot be aimed
/// at anybody else however it is shaped. That is what makes it safe to serve with no permission
/// gate — and a permission gate is precisely what was in the way.
///
/// WHY THIS IS NOT <c>GET /users/me</c> ANY MORE. That action lived on
/// <see cref="UsersController"/>, which carries
/// <c>[Authorize(Policy = PolicyNames.TenantContextRequired)]</c> at class level. Authorize
/// attributes on a controller and an action are ANDed, never overridden, so every route on that
/// controller — the caller's own record included — required a resolved Organisation. Two people
/// hit that:
///
///   - A SUPERADMIN WHO HAS NOT YET CHOSEN AN ORGANISATION. Their token is Global scope with no
///     tenant, so <c>TenantContextRequirement</c> fails and the answer is 403 with the generic
///     "You do not have permission to perform this action." On the one screen whose entire job
///     is to show a person their own profile.
///   - ANYBODY WITHOUT <c>iam.users.view</c>. The profile screen reached its own record through
///     the administrative directory search, which is permission-gated, so ten of the fifteen
///     roles were refused their own profile. The route itself was deliberately left unguarded
///     for them; the data call was not.
///
/// The query behind it is unchanged and was already written for this: <c>GetDetailAsync</c>
/// keeps the platform account visible to itself (see <c>ExcludePlatformAccountsExceptSelf</c>)
/// and the widened User query filter keeps a null-tenant row readable with no Organisation
/// resolved. Nothing here widens what anybody can see — it stops a check that was never about
/// this record from refusing it.
