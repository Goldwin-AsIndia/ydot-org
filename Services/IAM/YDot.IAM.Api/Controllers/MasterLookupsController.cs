/// The address-form pickers, for every page in the platform that is not a Masters screen.

/// WHY THIS CONTROLLER EXISTS AT ALL, AND IT IS NOT A DUPLICATE OF <see cref="MastersController"/>.
/// That one is gated on <c>PermissionCodes.GlobalMaster.Section</c> — correctly, because it
/// serves the five ADMIN screens, and the payload it returns is shaped for administering the
/// catalogue. But a country/state/city picker is not an administrative act. It appears on user
/// creation, organisation setup, lead capture, donation entry and the campaign wizard, and the
/// people filling those in have no business holding a Masters permission.
///
/// Before this existed, the only route to the catalogue was the gated one. Any page whose user
/// lacked <c>GlobalMaster.Section</c> got a 403 where a country list should have been — which is
/// precisely why those pages had hard-coded arrays of Indian states compiled into the bundle
/// instead. The permission was doing the opposite of its job: not protecting anything (the
/// countries of the world are not a secret) while pushing five screens onto stale copies of the
/// data.
///
/// SO THE GATE HERE IS AUTHENTICATION, NOT PERMISSION. <c>ActiveUserOnly</c> and nothing more,
/// which is the same reasoning <see cref="CountriesController"/> sets out for not requiring a
/// resolved Organisation. Isolation is not weakened: every read below runs through the scoped
/// query filter, so a caller still sees the platform catalogue plus their own Organisation's
/// additions and never another Organisation's. Nothing here writes.
///
/// NOTHING HERE 404s. Every route answers 200 with a usable list. An unknown country id narrows
/// nothing rather than failing, because a dropdown that returns an error is a dropdown a person
/// cannot get past — see <see cref="GetTimeZonesAsync"/> for the case that matters most.
///
/// AND IT IS <c>[AllowedWhileOnboarding]</c>, for the reason the rest of this comment argues.
/// <c>OrganisationApprovalMiddleware</c> denies by default, so without the marker every route
/// below was refused with TENANT_NOT_APPROVED for exactly as long as an Organisation was
/// Invited, ProfileIncomplete, Submitted, UnderReview, Rejected or Resubmitted — which is
/// precisely the window in which the profile has to be filled in. The visible bug was an empty
/// Country dropdown on the one screen that cannot be completed without it: `GeoMasterService`
/// turns a failed fetch into an empty list on purpose, so the refusal arrived as a picker with
/// nothing in it and no error to explain why. Reading the catalogue is not Tenant work; it is
/// what onboarding needs in order to become Tenant work.
