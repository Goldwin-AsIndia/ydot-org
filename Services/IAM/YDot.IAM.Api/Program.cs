    // 0. THE REAL CLIENT ADDRESS, before anything reads it.
    //
    // WHY THIS IS HERE. The API sits behind nginx, so without this every request appears to come
    // from the proxy's address. Two things then go wrong, and the first is severe:
    //
    //   - THE SIGN-IN RATE LIMIT BECOMES GLOBAL. SignInAttemptsPerMinutePerIp is 20; with one
    //     apparent address for the whole platform that is twenty sign-ins per minute for
    //     EVERYBODY, and a room full of people signing in for a demonstration throttle each
    //     other out.
    //   - Every audit row records the proxy as the actor's address, so "where did this come
    //     from" has one answer for every event ever recorded.
    //
    // WHICH PROXIES ARE TRUSTED is the part that has to be right, and it used to be written as
    // `KnownNetworks = { }` in an object initialiser — which adds nothing and leaves the
    // loopback-only defaults standing, so the header nginx sets was silently ignored and every
    // session recorded the proxy's own container address. See ForwardedHeadersConfiguration for
    // the full account and for the environment variable that narrows the trusted set.
    app.UseForwardedHeaders(ForwardedHeadersConfiguration.Build(builder.Configuration));

    // 1. Correlation first, so even a request rejected at the very edge carries an id.
    app.UseMiddleware<CorrelationIdMiddleware>();

    //    tenant resolution — and can still return the standard envelope.

    // 3. CORS BEFORE authentication. A preflight OPTIONS carries no token; if it reached the
    //    authentication middleware it would be challenged, the browser would never send the real
    //    request, and every call would fail with a message about CORS rather than about auth.

    //    most important line in the file.
    //
    //    After authentication, because the tenant_id claim on a VALIDATED token is the primary
    //    source and it does not exist until the token has been checked.
    //
    //    Before authorization, because the permission handlers and the EF query filters both
    //    read ITenantContext. Resolving later would leave the first checks running with no
    //    Organisation, and query filters silently matching nothing — or worse, everything.
    app.UseMiddleware<TenantResolutionMiddleware>();

    // 5. The approval gate, between the two. It needs the Organisation status that tenant
    //    resolution has just established, and it must run before authorization because the
    //    refusal has to be identical for every endpoint - a TenantAdmin holds every Tenant
    //    permission from the moment their Organisation is created, so leaving this to the
    //    permission handlers would let an unapproved Organisation work normally.
