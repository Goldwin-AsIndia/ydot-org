/// payment.
///
/// IT READS AND WRITES DON'S TABLES DIRECTLY, over the database all four services share. That is
/// a deliberate decision with a real trade-off, so it is worth stating plainly.
///
/// WHY NOT AN HTTP CALL TO DON. Section 15 says the donor record is created as part of recording
/// a successful payment. If that step were an HTTP call it would sit inside the transaction that
/// writes the donation, and a DON outage - or a slow response, or a timeout that succeeded on the
/// far side - would either roll back a payment the gateway has already captured or leave a
/// donation with no donor. Money has already moved by this point; the write must be local and
/// atomic.
///
/// WHY NOT A PROJECT REFERENCE TO DON. That would make PAY depend on DON's domain assembly and
/// give it DON's whole model, migrations included - two services able to migrate the same tables
/// is worse than a narrow SQL seam.
///
/// SO THE SEAM IS THIS FILE, AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NARROW: four statements against three
/// columns sets. Every one is parameterised, every one is scoped by organisation_id, and if
/// donors ever move to their own database only this class changes.
///
/// EVERY LOOKUP IS "ORGANISATION AND E-MAIL", NEVER E-MAIL ALONE. Section 26 is explicit: the
/// same person may give to two charities on this platform and be a known donor to one and a
/// stranger to the other. A global e-mail match would tell charity A that a donor of charity B
/// exists, which is a disclosure in itself.
