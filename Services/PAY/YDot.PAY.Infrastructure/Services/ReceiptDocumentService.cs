/// Renders a receipt into a document and delivers it to the donor.
///
/// THE DOCUMENT IS HTML, NOT PDF, and that is a deliberate choice rather than a shortcut. A PDF
/// would mean taking a rendering engine as a dependency - a headless browser, a licensed library
/// or a native binary - and every one of those is a deployment problem that belongs to the
/// installation rather than to this module. The HTML produced here prints to PDF correctly from
/// any browser, is what an e-mail client can show inline, and is small enough to store cheaply
/// for the seven-plus years a tax document has to survive.
///
/// EVERY DONOR-SUPPLIED VALUE IS HTML-ENCODED. A donor's name goes into this document verbatim,
/// the document is stored and later served, and a name containing a script tag would otherwise
/// execute in the browser of whoever opened it - including the finance officer reviewing the
/// receipt register.
///
/// RENDERING AND DELIVERY ARE SEPARATE because they fail independently. A receipt is issued the
/// moment it is numbered and recorded; producing the document and getting it into an inbox are
/// later steps that can fail without making the receipt any less valid. Collapsing them would
/// make a bounced e-mail look like an unissued receipt.
