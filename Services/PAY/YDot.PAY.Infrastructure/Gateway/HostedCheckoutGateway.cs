/// The payment provider adapter: a hosted-checkout gateway spoken to over a documented REST
/// contract, with HMAC-SHA256 webhook signatures.
///
/// WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. It is a complete implementation of <see cref="IPaymentGateway"/>
/// against the hosted-checkout shape that Razorpay, Stripe Checkout, PayU and Cashfree all
/// share: create a link, redirect the donor, receive a signed webhook, verify by reference,
/// refund by reference. It is NOT tied to any one of those vendors' SDKs - the endpoints and the
/// field names are configuration, so pointing it at a specific provider is a settings change plus
/// (where a vendor deviates) a subclass overriding <see cref="MapStatus"/> and
/// <see cref="MapEventType"/>.
///
/// THE THREE RULES THAT ARE THIS MODULE'S RATHER THAN ANY PROVIDER'S:
///
///   1. AN UNKNOWN OUTCOME IS NOT A FAILURE. A network timeout means the charge may have
///      succeeded, so it maps to <see cref="PaymentAttemptStatus.TimedOut"/> - which the module
///      resolves by VERIFYING, never by retrying. Reporting it as failed would let a donor be
///      charged twice.
///   2. THE SIGNATURE IS CHECKED IN CONSTANT TIME. A byte-by-byte comparison that returns early
///      leaks, through timing, how much of a forged signature was correct - which is enough to
///      forge one given enough attempts.
///   3. NOTHING IS TRUSTED FROM AN UNSIGNED WEBHOOK. Anybody can post to a webhook URL. An event
///      whose signature fails is stored for investigation and never acted on.
///
/// NO SECRET IS EVER PASSED IN. The credentials are resolved from configuration using the
/// reference held on the account row, so a key never travels through the application layer and
/// never reaches an audit row or a log line.
