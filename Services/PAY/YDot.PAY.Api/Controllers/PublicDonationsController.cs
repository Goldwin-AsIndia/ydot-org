/// <summary>
/// The donor-facing donation flow - sections 11 to 14 and 19 to 23.
///
/// EVERY ACTION HERE IS <c>[AllowAnonymous]</c>, and that is the defining fact about this
/// controller. The donor is a stranger with a QR code, a link in an e-mail or a button on a web
/// page; they have no account, no token and no session. Requiring one would mean asking somebody
/// to register before they are allowed to give money, which is the single most reliable way to
/// lose a donation.
///
/// SO WHAT PROTECTS IT? Four things, and it is worth being explicit because "anonymous" and
/// "unprotected" are not the same word:
///
///   1. THE ORGANISATION IS NEVER TAKEN FROM THE BODY. It is resolved by the tenant middleware
///      from the intent reference in the route, or from the tracking reference the donor
///      followed. A caller cannot name a charity to donate against.
///   2. EVERY REFERENCE IS UNGUESSABLE - twelve characters from a 31-character alphabet, about
///      59 bits. Reaching somebody else's donation means guessing one, not incrementing one.
///   3. NOTHING HERE RETURNS UNMASKED DONOR DETAIL. The result page shows a masked e-mail even
///      to the donor themselves, because the endpoint is reachable by anybody holding the link.
///   4. THE PERMITTED ACTIONS COME BACK EMPTY OF STAFF ACTIONS, because they are computed with a
///      permission probe that answers false to everything.
///
/// THE STAFF EQUIVALENTS OF THESE ROUTES LIVE IN <see cref="DonationIntentsController"/> and
/// require both a token and a permission. Two controllers rather than one set of endpoints with
/// a conditional: an endpoint that is anonymous under some conditions is one whose security is
/// decided by a branch somebody will eventually get wrong.
