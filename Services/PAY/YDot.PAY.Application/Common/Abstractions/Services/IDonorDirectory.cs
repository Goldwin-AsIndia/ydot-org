/// SECTION 26 IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS INTERFACE EXISTS. The existing-donor check is
/// "OrganisationId AND NormalisedEmail", never e-mail alone: the same person may give to two
/// charities on this platform and be a known donor to one and a stranger to the other.
///
/// WHY IT IS AN ABSTRACTION RATHER THAN A DIRECT QUERY. Donors live in DON and user accounts
/// live in IAM; PAY owns neither. It reads the donor table it shares a database with and calls
/// IAM for the account, and keeping both behind one interface means the handlers express the
/// BUSINESS steps of section 15 - find donor, create donor, create account, send invite - rather
/// than the mechanics of where each record lives.

    /// an administrator has a login and is not a donor, so the donor lookup answers "no" for them
    /// and the public form let them start a fresh anonymous donation under an address that already
    /// has an account behind it.

    /// WHAT IT IS FOR. Section 3 of the flow document: "If the email matches an existing Donor
    /// the person is redirected to Login. After logging in, the donor is taken to the Payment
    /// page." That redirect has to fire for anybody who can sign in, not only for people who have
    /// given before - otherwise a member of staff typing their own address is quietly treated as
    /// a stranger and the donation is recorded against a second, unlinked identity.
    ///
    /// IT IS NOT AN ORACLE. The answer never leaves the server as a bare yes for an address the
