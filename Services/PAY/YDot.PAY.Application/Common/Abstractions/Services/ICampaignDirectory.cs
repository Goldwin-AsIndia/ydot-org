/// between an HTTP call per row, a join across a boundary PAY does not own, or one narrow,
/// read-only lookup behind an interface. The last is what this is: the implementation reads the
/// campaign table it shares a database with, and if campaigns ever move to their own database
/// only the implementation changes.
///
/// EVERY METHOD IS SCOPED BY ORGANISATION. A campaign id arriving on a donation intent came from
/// a request, and resolving it without scoping would let somebody attribute a gift to another
/// charity's campaign - and then see that campaign's name come back, confirming it exists.
