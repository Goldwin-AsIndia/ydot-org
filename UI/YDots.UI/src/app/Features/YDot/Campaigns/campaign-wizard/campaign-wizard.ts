    // projection Campaign Register's own table is built from — code, name, dates, status and a
    // few counts. Country, State, City, Zip code, currency, channels, the Publication & Notice
    // wording and the activation/reminder fields all live on the DETAIL response only (see
    // `CampaignStoreService.mergeDetail`), which nothing was asking for. The one call below

    // State and City among them, but not only them.

    // it takes the detail to arrive; `loadDetail` is asked for the rest, and the effect below

    // update (a background refresh replaces every record with a new object, and re-running this
    // on each one would silently overwrite whatever the person is mid-typing).
