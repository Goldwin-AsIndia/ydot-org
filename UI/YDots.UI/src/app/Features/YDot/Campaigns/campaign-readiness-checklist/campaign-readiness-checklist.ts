   *     been submitted".

  // Template and Consent read from a stub standing in for domains that do not exist yet. They
  // caused three separate faults:
  //
  //   - THEIR VERDICTS DID NOT SURVIVE THE PAGE. "Pass" on one of them wrote to a component
  //     signal, because there is no server record to write to: a blocker or a verdict hangs off a
  //     readiness CHECK, and 'budget' is not a check id. So passing them, navigating away and
  //     coming back put every one of them back to Pending, and the same reason made "Assign
  //     blocker" on any of them fail outright.
  //   - THEY HELD THE LAUNCH REQUEST SHUT. Request approval was gated on Budget approval AND
  //     Tracking readiness both passing. Budget & Target Plans is on hold, so no plan can be
  //     allocated, so Budget approval could never leave Pending — and Request approval could
  //     never be enabled for any campaign on the platform without recording an "exception".
  //     The server does not ask for any of this at submit; the readiness gate it does enforce is
  //     on ACTIVATE, and it names the outstanding checks itself.
  //   - THEY DILUTED THE COUNTS. Six cards nobody added, four of them permanently Pending, sat in
  //     the Passed/Failed/Pending/Total tiles and in the readiness meter beside the checks that
  //     had actually been assessed.
