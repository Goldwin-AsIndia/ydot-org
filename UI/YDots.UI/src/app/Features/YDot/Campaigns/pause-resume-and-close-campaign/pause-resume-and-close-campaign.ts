    //    LIFECYCLE ENDPOINT. They all called `campaignStore.update(ref, { status })`, and that is
    //    the generic content PUT: it wrote the status into the local record, sent a body that
    //    carries no status at all, and then refreshed - so the server's state never moved and
    //    the refresh put the old one straight back. Activate, Pause, Resume and Approve close
    //    were all reported as done and none of them had happened.
    //
    // 2. THE OUTCOME IS THE SERVER'S ANSWER, NOT A TIMER. This whole block ran inside a 700 ms
    //    `setTimeout` that then set the success panel unconditionally - so even once the calls
    //    were real, a refused transition (a 409 from a campaign somebody else had already moved,
    //    a 403, an expectedVersion conflict) would still have painted "Saved successfully. state
    //    Active" over a campaign that had not moved. A refusal now shows the server's message.
    //
    // THE CLOSE-REQUEST RECORD IS DELIBERATELY STILL LOCAL. `request_close` writes only to the
    // close-request store - the campaign's own state does not change on a request - so it has no
    // transition to wait for and commits directly.
