/**
 * Deciding what appears in the menu, and for whom.
 *
 * THE MENU A PERSON SEES IS THE INTERSECTION OF FOUR THINGS:
 *
 *     platform catalogue      what the product HAS
 *   ∩ organisation config     what this organisation TURNED ON   ← the first tab
 *   ∩ role mapping            what this role was GIVEN           ← the second tab
 *   ∩ held permissions        what this person may actually DO
 *
 * This screen owns the two middle steps. The first is fixed by the product; the last is decided
 * by the role's permissions and is not editable here — a menu item mapped to a role whose holder
 * lacks the permission simply never appears, which is why the mapping tab shows the permission
 * each node needs.
 *
 * THREE RULES THE SERVER ENFORCES, AND THIS SCREEN MAKES VISIBLE
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * Disabling a parent disables its children. A reachable child under a hidden parent is a hole in
 * the navigation, not a convenience, so the toggles cascade downwards.
 *
 * ENABLING A CHILD ENABLES ITS PARENTS, and this is the half that was missing. The tree is only
 * ever walked from the top, so a node whose parent is off is not rendered however it is set — it
 * is not indented under a greyed-out heading, it is absent. Ticking one child on and saving
 * therefore reported success and changed nothing anybody could see, which reads exactly like a
 * save that was thrown away. Turning a node on now turns on the section it lives in.
 *
 * A node the organisation has not enabled can still be mapped to a role, but it shows nobody
 * anything until the organisation switches it on — so the row says so, rather than leaving
 * somebody to wonder why a saved mapping had no effect.
 *
 * AND NONE OF IT IS A SECURITY BOUNDARY. Hiding a link is a courtesy; every endpoint behind it
 * re-checks its own permission on every request.
