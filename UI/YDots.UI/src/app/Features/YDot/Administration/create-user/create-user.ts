 * WHAT THIS SCREEN PRODUCES
 * -------------------------
 * A real account and a real invitation e-mail. Pressing "Create and send invitation" calls the
 * API, which creates the record, generates a single-use token, stores only its hash, and e-mails
 * a link to `/auth/invitation?token=…`. That link is the first step of the activation stepper.
 *
 * So the loop is: create here → e-mail → activate there → the directory shows the account as
 * Active, with MFA reading **Enrolled** if they added a second factor.
 *
 * WHY THE DROPDOWNS ARE LOADED, NOT TYPED
 * ---------------------------------------
 * Roles and organisation units are identifiers, not words. The previous version collected the
 * *name* of a role from a text list and stored it in a browser cache, which is why nothing it
 * created ever existed on the server. Every option here comes from
 * `GET /users/invite-or-create-user-guided-flow`, already filtered to what this administrator is
 * allowed to grant.
