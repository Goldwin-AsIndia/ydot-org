/**
 * Where the donor lands after paying — the return half of the public donation flow.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Razorpay's payment link took the donor away from us and, with no
 * callback configured, left them on Razorpay's own page. Nothing brought them back, so nothing
 * ever called verify: the donation sat Pending in the queue, no receipt was issued, no e-mail
 * went out and no donor account was created, until an administrator happened to open Support &
 * Retry and press Verify status. The money had moved and the system did not know.
 *
 * IT WORKS ON LOCALHOST, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE DESIGN. Two things happen here and neither
 * needs Razorpay to reach us:
 *
 *   1. THE RETURN IS A BROWSER REDIRECT. Razorpay sends the DONOR'S OWN BROWSER to this page and
 *      appends `razorpay_payment_link_reference_id` — our intent reference, set as the link's
 *      ReferenceId when it was created. A browser on the same machine reaches
 *      http://localhost:6700 perfectly well.
 *   2. VERIFICATION IS A PULL. This page asks our server, and our server asks Razorpay
 *      (GET payment_links/{id}). The connection is outbound in both hops.
 *
 * So a development machine with no public address, no tunnel and no registered webhook still
 * completes the whole flow. A webhook is the right thing in production — it also catches the
 * donor who pays and then closes the tab — but it is not a prerequisite for testing.
 *
 * IT NEVER DECIDES THE OUTCOME ITSELF. `razorpay_payment_link_status` arrives on the query
 * string and this page deliberately ignores it as evidence: it is a value in a URL the donor
 * could edit. It is used only to word the "checking" line. The state shown comes from our own
 * verify endpoint, which asked the gateway.
 *
 * PENDING IS POLLED, NOT REPORTED AS FAILURE. Capture can lag the redirect by a second or two,
 * and a donor told "failed" tries again — if the first attempt actually succeeded, they have now
 * given twice. So a pending answer is retried a few times before this settles on "still
 * confirming", which is the honest word for it.
 *
 * A CONFIRMED DONATION DOES NOT END HERE ANY MORE. This page used to render "Thank you" and stop,
 * with no link and no navigation of any kind on the confirmed branch — so whoever had just paid
 * was left on a dead end with the browser's Back button as their only way out, and Back leads to
 * the checkout they have already completed. Confirmation now returns them to the donation screen
 * on a short countdown; only the confirmed branch redirects, because "pending" and "failed" are
 * states somebody has to be able to sit with and read.

   * simplification. It is true only when the payer's e-mail matches a donor record, so a

   * public donor form having been signed in the whole time.
