 * One row of the merged register, in the shape the template binds to.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * HOW THE MERGE IS DONE - THERE IS NO UNIFIED BACKEND ENDPOINT (YET)
 * ============================================================================================
 * There is no single API that returns Success + Pending + Fail together, so this component
 * composes the two calls that already exist and were already correct on their own screens:
 *
 *   - PaymentApiService.searchPaymentEvents(...)  -> Fail and Pending rows. This is the only
 *     source for them: a successful payment never reaches this queue (see SCR-PAY-003), and this
 *     is also the only source with the fields Retry actually needs - donationIntentId, version,
 *     attempts, gatewayEventId.
 *   - PaymentApiService.getReceiptRegister(...) filtered to status 'Success' -> Success rows,
 *     because only an issued receipt has a real receipt number, and only the register knows it.
 *
 * Failed rows are taken from the queue, not the register, even though the register's union also
 * contains failed intents - the queue's copy carries donor email, gateway event id and version,
 * which the register's row does not, and Retry needs all three.
 *
 * WHEN NO STATUS FILTER IS APPLIED ("All statuses"), both sources are fetched up to
 * `mergedBatchSize` rows each and merged/sorted client-side, because true cross-source pagination
 * and a single accurate "Showing X of Y" require a real backend union - which does not exist yet.
 * The summary tiles do NOT have this limitation: they come from two lightweight, unpaged count
 * requests (see `loadSummary`), so they stay accurate for the whole scope regardless of how many
 * rows are actually fetched for display.
 *
 * WHEN A SINGLE STATUS IS SELECTED (Success, Pending or Fail), only one source is queried and
 * pagination is exact, the same as it always was on the two original screens.
 *
 * If/when a real `GET /payments/receipts-register` union endpoint is added server-side, this
 * whole composition block is what it should replace.

 *                StillPending / sent-to-Support exactly as before).
 *   - Pending -> Continue payment, handing over only the reference (never donor data) to the
