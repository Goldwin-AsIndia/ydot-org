/**
 * THE BROWSER NEVER HOLDS A RAZORPAY KEY, and that is the change that matters most on this
 * screen. It used to open Razorpay Checkout itself with `key: 'rzp_test_TCwSZidEO9q88a'`
 * compiled into the bundle, which meant three things at once:
 *
 *   - THE KEY WAS PUBLIC. Anyone who opened dev-tools on the donation page could read it and
 *     raise charges against this charity's account from anywhere.
 *   - NOTHING WAS VERIFIED. `handler` believed whatever the browser handed back, so a donation
 *     was "successful" because a script said so - no signature check, no gateway confirmation.
 *   - THE AMOUNT WAS DECIDED CLIENT-SIDE. `amount: Math.round(amount * 100)` came from a signal
 *     a person could edit; a donor could have paid one rupee against a ten-thousand intent.
 *
 * The flow the YDot Donation Flow document describes is the server's: Submit creates the intent
 * (section 2), the server checks Lead/Donor (section 3), and the server issues a Razorpay
 * payment link using credentials only it holds. The donor is sent to that link. The outcome
 * comes back from the gateway - webhook, or the verify poll - never from this page.
