 * The shared client state behind the twelve Donors and Leads screens.

 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT MATTERED. Every screen used to import a JSON file at BUILD TIME and
 * push it into this store through a `seed*` method; the store then kept the result in
 * localStorage so it survived a refresh. Four consequences followed and all four were real:
 *
 *   - NOTHING REACHED THE SERVER. A lead accepted, contacted or qualified existed in one
 *     browser's local storage and nowhere else. Two people working the same queue never saw one
 *     another's work.
 *   - THE DATA WAS IDENTICAL FOR EVERY ORGANISATION, because a file compiled into the bundle has
 *     no idea who is asking. Tenant isolation stopped at the API boundary.
 *   - THE MASKING RULES COULD NOT WORK. Whether a donor's phone number is shown depends on a
 *     permission the server checks; a static file has one answer for everybody, and that answer
 *     was "show it".
 *   - `registerDonorFromPayment` INVENTED DONOR RECORDS in the browser, complete with generated
 *     DON-2026-###### references. Those numbers duplicated real ones the moment anybody else
 *     created a donor.
 *
 * IT NOW LOADS FROM `DON /api/v1/donors`, while keeping its SYNCHRONOUS SIGNAL SURFACE. That
 * shape is deliberate: twelve screens read `leads()`, `donors()`, `getLead(id)` and their
 * siblings from templates and computed properties, and turning those into observables would mean
 * rewriting all twelve. Reads stay synchronous against the loaded signals; writes go to the API
 * and refresh them.
 *
 * THE SIGNALS ARE A CACHE OF THE SERVER'S ANSWER, not the source of truth. `refresh()` reloads
 * them and every write calls it on completion, so a screen never shows a state the server did
 * not agree to.
 *
 * THE `seed*` METHODS ARE NO-OPS NOW and are kept only so the twelve call sites still compile.
 * Each one says so where it is defined.

   * lead file, and deleted the matching lead from local storage. Every part of that is now the
   * server's:
   *
   *   - The DONOR RECORD is created by the payments service, inside the transaction that records
   *     the donation, so a donor cannot exist for a gift that rolled back.
   *   - The REFERENCE is allocated from the existing per-organisation sequence, so it cannot
   *     duplicate one somebody else is using.
   *   - The LEAD CONVERSION is `POST /lead-work-queue/{id}/convert`, which preserves the lead's
   *     history and attribution rather than deleting it - the campaign that produced the lead is
   *     what makes the donation attributable afterwards.
   *
   * The method is kept as a no-op returning the existing record because the public donation
   * screen calls it after a payment. Refreshing is what makes the new donor appear.
   *
   * The input accepts the full donation payload the public form carries (mobile, campaign,
   * amount, paid) so its call sites compile unchanged. Only `name` and `email` are read —
   * they are the match keys used to find the donor the payment belongs to.
