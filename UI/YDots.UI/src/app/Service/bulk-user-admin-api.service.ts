/**
 * Bulk administration: doing one thing to many people at once.
 *
 * THE TWO-STEP SHAPE IS THE POINT
 * --------------------------------
 * Creating an operation VALIDATES the selection and reports what would happen, row by row,
 * without changing anything. Applying it then carries it out. Somebody suspending forty accounts
 * gets to see that three of them are already suspended and one is the platform administrator
 * BEFORE it happens, rather than discovering it in the audit trail afterwards.
 *
 * `applyImmediately` collapses the two for a caller that genuinely wants one step — an automated
 * import, say. A person driving a screen should not use it.
 *
 * PARTIAL SUCCESS IS A REAL RESULT, NOT A FAILURE. Forty-seven of fifty succeeding is exactly
 * what happened, and the three that did not are listed with their reasons. Rolling back the
 * forty-seven because of three would be worse: the work was valid and would have to be done
 * again.
