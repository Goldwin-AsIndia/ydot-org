/**
 * The user directory: searching, opening and administering the people in one Organisation.
 *
 * NO ORGANISATION IS EVER SENT. Not on the search, not on an action, not on the export. The
 * Organisation comes from the signed token, which is the whole reason a TEN001 administrator
 * cannot reach a TEN002 user however the request is shaped: there is no parameter to change.
 *
 * WHY THE DIRECTORY IS ASSEMBLED FROM TWO CALLS
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * The screen needs a page of people AND the options for its filters — statuses, departments,
 * roles. The API serves those separately, and rightly: the filter options change once a month
 * and the page changes on every keystroke. Fetching them together on the first load and the page
 * alone afterwards is what keeps typing in the search box from re-fetching the whole reference
 * set thirty times a minute.
 *
 * EVERY ACTION CARRIES ExpectedVersion. Two administrators on the same record means the second
 * one is told to reload rather than silently overwriting the first.
