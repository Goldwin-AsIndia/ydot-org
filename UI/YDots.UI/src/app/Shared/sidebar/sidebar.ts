/**
 * The sidebar.
 *
 * EVERY ITEM COMES FROM THE SERVER. This used to be a twelve-hundred-line hand-written tree, and
 * the trouble with that is not its length — it is that a hand-written menu shows every link to
 * everybody. What a person may see depends on what the product has, what their Organisation has
 * enabled, what their role was given and what permissions they hold, and only the server knows
 * all four. See `NavigationService` for the rest of that reasoning.
 *
 * THREE LEVELS, RENDERED AS THREE LEVELS. Menu, submenu and child submenu each have their own
 * markup in the theme, so the template handles them explicitly rather than recursing — which
 * also means a fourth level, if one ever appeared, would be visibly missing rather than silently
 * flattened.
 *
 * IT NO LONGER FETCHES ANYTHING ON MOUNT. It used to load the tree when it found the menu empty,
 * which is a rule that reads sensibly and is wrong in the one case that matters: after an
 * Organisation switch the menu is not empty, it is FULL — of the previous Organisation's items —
 * so the condition was false and the stale tree stayed. Loading is `NavigationService`'s job now,
 * keyed to the Organisation rather than to emptiness. This component renders what it is given.
