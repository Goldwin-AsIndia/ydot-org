 * holds the per-field detail for a form.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE IS HAND-WRITTEN WHEN THE REST ARE GENERATED
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * OpenAPI has no generics, so the server's `ApiResponse<T>` arrives in the document flattened
 * into 120-odd concrete types — `UserDetailResponseApiResponse`, and so on. Those exist in
 * `iam-contract.model.ts` and are perfectly correct, but writing `ApiResponse<UserDetail>` reads
 * far better at every call site than naming a different type for each one. The two agree on
 * every field; only the generic is added back here.
