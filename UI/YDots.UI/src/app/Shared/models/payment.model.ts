/**
 * The typed contract for the Donations and Payments service.
 *
 * IT MIRRORS THE SERVER'S DTOs FIELD FOR FIELD, and the field NAMES are copied rather than
 * improved. A name invented on this side is `undefined` at runtime, which is the failure this
 * file exists to prevent: TypeScript cannot check a shape it was told the wrong name for.
 *
 * TWO CONVENTIONS RUN THROUGH THE WHOLE MODULE AND ARE WORTH READING ONCE.
 *
 * `permittedActions` IS THE SERVER'S ANSWER TO "what may this caller do next". It is computed
 * from the record's state AND the caller's permissions AND, on a refund, who raised the case -
 * which is a rule no permission code can express. Render buttons FROM it. A screen that decides
 * for itself will eventually draw a button that answers 409, and the refund case is exactly
 * where that happens: approve is withheld from the person who requested it, whatever permissions
 * they hold.
 *
 * `version` IS THE OPTIMISTIC-CONCURRENCY STAMP. Every state-changing call sends the version it
 * read back as `expectedVersion`, and a screen holding a stale one gets a 409 rather than
 * silently overwriting somebody else's change. On this module that somebody else may have
 * refunded the donation.
