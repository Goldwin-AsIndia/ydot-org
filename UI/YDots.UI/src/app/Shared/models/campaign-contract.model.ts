 * The typed contract for the Campaign service.

 * IT MIRRORS THE SERVER'S DTOs FIELD FOR FIELD, and the field NAMES are copied rather than
 * improved. A name invented on this side is `undefined` at runtime, which is exactly the failure
 * this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * THREE CONVENTIONS RUN THROUGH THE MODULE.
 *
 * `permittedActions` IS THE SERVER'S ANSWER to what this caller may do next. On a campaign it
 * folds in something no permission code can express: SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. The person who
 * created or submitted a campaign cannot approve it, whatever permissions they hold, so a screen
 * that decided for itself would draw an Approve button that answers 409.
 *
 * `version` IS THE OPTIMISTIC-CONCURRENCY STAMP. Every state-changing call sends the version it
 * read back as `expectedVersion`; a stale one answers 409 rather than overwriting a colleague's
 * lifecycle change.
 *
 * DATES ARE STRINGS AND SO ARE DATE-ONLY VALUES. `startDate` is `yyyy-MM-dd` with no time and no
 * zone - a campaign starting on the 1st starts on the 1st wherever anybody reads it - while
 * `activeFrom` on a tracking asset is a full instant. The two are not interchangeable, and the
 * types say so.
