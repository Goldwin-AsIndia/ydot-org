/**
 * The signed-in identity in the top bar, the Organisation switcher, and sign-out.
 *
 * WHERE THE NAME COMES FROM
 * -------------------------
 * One place: `AuthTokenService`, which holds what the API returned at sign-in. An earlier version
 * tried `sessionStorage.userData`, then `sessionStorage.loginResponse`, then fell back to a JSON
 * file of sample data — so a failed sign-in could still leave a plausible-looking name in the
 * header, and the header could disagree with the rest of the app. A signal means the value is
 * live: sign out, and this updates by itself with no event wiring.
 *
 * THE ORGANISATION SWITCHER
 * -------------------------
 * Only a root user sees it, because only a root user has anything to switch between. Choosing an
 * Organisation asks the SERVER to re-issue the access token against it; there is no client-side
 * setting that could be flipped instead. The new navigation is fetched as part of that switch —
 * see `OrganisationContextService` — because what a person may see genuinely differs between
 * Organisations, and leaving the reload to each caller is what let one of them forget.
 *
 * And selecting an Organisation does not change who the person is. A root user has no
 * Organisation of their own and never acquires one by looking at somebody's data — which is why
 * the bar shows "working inside X" rather than presenting it as their own.
