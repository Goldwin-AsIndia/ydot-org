/**
 * The single shared source of truth for campaign data.

 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT MATTERED. The records used to live in a signal seeded with ten
 * hard-coded campaigns compiled into the bundle. Every screen read and mutated that array:
 * approving flipped a string, deleting spliced, creating pushed. Four consequences followed and
 * all four were real:
 *
 *   - NOTHING WAS EVER SAVED. A campaign approved on Monday was Draft again on Tuesday.
 *   - EVERY ORGANISATION SAW THE SAME TEN CAMPAIGNS, because an array in a browser has no idea
 *     who is asking. Tenant isolation stopped at the API boundary.
 *   - THE APPROVAL RULES WERE DECORATIVE. `submitForApproval` decided the tier from a role string
 *     the browser supplied, so anybody could have approved anything by editing it.
 *   - Segregation of duties could not work at all: the rule is "not the person who submitted",
 *     and the browser cannot be trusted to say who that was.
 *
 * IT NOW READS AND WRITES `CAM /api/v1/campaigns`, while keeping its SYNCHRONOUS SIGNAL SURFACE.
 * That shape is deliberate: eleven screens call `all()`, `get(ref)` and the lifecycle methods
 * from templates and computed properties, and turning those into observables would mean
 * rewriting every one of them. Reads stay synchronous against the loaded signal; writes go to
 * the API and refresh it.
 *
 * THE SIGNAL IS A CACHE OF THE SERVER'S ANSWER, not the source of truth. `refresh()` reloads it,
 * and every write calls that on completion - so a screen never shows a state the server did not
 * agree to.
