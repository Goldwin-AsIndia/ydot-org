/**
 * The sidebar, as the server decides it.
 *
 * WHY THE MENU IS NOT WRITTEN IN THE TEMPLATE
 * -------------------------------------------
 * What a person may see depends on four things, and only the server knows all four: what the
 * product HAS, what this Organisation has TURNED ON, what their role was GIVEN, and what
 * permissions they actually HOLD. A menu written in HTML knows none of them, so it shows every
 * link to everybody and relies on each screen to be empty for the people who should not be there
 * — which is a worse experience and a much wider surface to get wrong.
 *
 * THE TREE IS NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY, and it is worth being explicit about that. Hiding a link
 * is a courtesy. Every endpoint behind it re-checks its own permission on every request, so a
 * hand-typed URL reaches a screen that cannot load anything. If the menu were the control,
 * editing this object in dev tools would be an attack; because it is not, it is a way of making
 * your own sidebar untidy.
 *
 * IT IS RELOADED AFTER AN ORGANISATION SWITCH, because the answer genuinely differs between
 * Organisations: the same root user sees different navigation inside TEN001 and TEN002.
 *
 * AND IT RELOADS ITSELF, which is the part that was wrong. The tree used to be a plain cache that
 * whoever switched Organisation was expected to refresh by hand, so it was only ever as correct as
 * the least careful call site — and the Organisation directory, one of the three places that can
 * switch, never refreshed it at all. Stepping into TEN001 from there left the platform menu up;
 * walking back to Manage Organisations afterwards left TEN001's menu up. The tree is now KEYED to
 * the Organisation it was built for and reloads whenever that changes, whoever changed it.

   *                       speak in one icon set's class names - the icon set is a choice this
   *                       client makes, and a server emitting `ri-settings-3-line` would have
   *                       made it on the client's behalf. Mapped, and mapped FIRST, because the
   *                       mapping is a curated choice: "grid" means ri-dashboard-line, which is
   *                       not what prefixing would produce.

   *   "bear-smile-fill"   a RAW icon name, chosen in the icon picker. The picker offers all 3,058
   *                       icons in the bundled font, and none of them but the fifty below were
   *                       known here - so an administrator picked an icon, the configuration
   *                       screen drew it, and the sidebar drew the fallback dot. Two resolvers
   *                       disagreeing about the same stored value is the whole defect.
   *
   *   "ri-bear-smile-line" already a class, from anything that stored the prefixed form.
