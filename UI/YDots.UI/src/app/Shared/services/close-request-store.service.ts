/**
 * Campaign close requests and the lifecycle history behind them.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT MATTERED. Both the records and the history lived in signals keyed by
 * campaign reference, created on demand and never sent anywhere. Closing a campaign is the one
 * decision in the module that stops it taking donations, and the local version got every part of
 * it wrong:
 *
 *   - THE INDEPENDENT-APPROVER RULE WAS DECIDED FROM `requestedByRef`, a field this browser wrote.
 *     The rule that the person who asks for a closure cannot also approve it therefore compared
 *     one browser's claim against the same browser's session - it was advisory at best, and the
 *     comment in the file said the store existed to make it "survive a session switch".
 *   - `version` COUNTED THIS BROWSER'S EDITS. That version drove the conflict state, so two people
 *     approving the same closure at the same moment each saw 1 become 2 and neither saw a conflict.
 *   - THE HISTORY WAS APPEND-ONLY IN ONE TAB. An accountable history that only its author can see
 *     records nothing.
 *
 * IT NOW READS AND WRITES `CAM /api/v1/campaigns/{id}` and the lifecycle endpoints. The request and
 * the approval are two separate server-side transitions, and the server enforces that they are
 * taken by two different people - checked against the stored requester rather than against anything
 * the client says.
