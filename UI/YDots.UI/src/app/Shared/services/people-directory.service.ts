 * of those copies had the same three problems:
 *
 *   - THE PEOPLE DID NOT EXIST. Assigning a campaign to 'USR-0114' assigned it to nobody, and the
 *     screen then displayed 'Arun Kumar' as the accountable owner of that campaign. A blocker
 *     owned by a person who does not exist is a blocker nobody is working on.
 *   - EVERY ORGANISATION SAW THE SAME FIVE NAMES, because a constant in a bundle does not know who
 *     is asking. One charity's screen offered another charity's staff.
 *   - THE COPIES DISAGREED. Two of the six listed people the other four did not, so the name shown
 *     against an owner depended on which screen you were looking at.
 *
 * IT NOW READS THE IAM USER DIRECTORY, which is organisation-scoped server-side: a caller sees the
 * people in their own data scope and nobody else's.
 *
 * THE SURFACE IS SYNCHRONOUS because these are selector options and name lookups read from
 * templates. The load happens once on first injection and the signal fills in; a name asked for
 * before it arrives comes back as the reference itself, which is honest - it shows an unresolved
 * id rather than inventing a person to go with it.
