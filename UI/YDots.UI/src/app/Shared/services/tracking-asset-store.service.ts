 * The single shared source of truth for tracking assets.

 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT MATTERED. The records lived in a signal seeded with ten hard-coded
 * assets compiled into the bundle, and every screen read and mutated that array. Four
 * consequences followed and all four were real:
 *
 *   - NOTHING WAS EVER SAVED. An asset approved on Monday was pending again on Tuesday.
 *   - THE GENERATED URL WAS A STRING TEMPLATE. `ydot.link/qr/QR-EDU-001` was composed in the
 *     browser from a reference the browser also invented. A QR code printed from it would have
 *     led nowhere - and a printed QR code is not recoverable.
 *   - EVERY ORGANISATION SAW THE SAME TEN ASSETS, because an array in a browser has no idea who
 *     is asking.
 *   - The "cannot approve your own asset" rule was decided from a createdByRef the browser
 *     supplied, so anybody could have approved anything by editing it.
 *
 * IT NOW READS AND WRITES `CAM /api/v1/tracking-assets`, while keeping its SYNCHRONOUS SIGNAL
 * SURFACE - three screens call `all()`, `forCampaign(ref)` and `get(ref)` from templates and
 * computed properties, and turning those into observables would mean rewriting all three. Reads
 * stay synchronous against the loaded signal; writes go to the API and refresh it.
 *
 * THE REFERENCE AND THE URL ARE THE SERVER'S. An asset has neither until it is APPROVED, which
 * is why both are nullable on the API's detail and why a screen must not offer a QR code for a
 * draft.
